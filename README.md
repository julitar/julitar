I'm an E-learning specialist with over 10 years of experience in the education field. I've had the privilege of leading two different digital transformation projects with a social impact. I possess a strong knowledge of UX fundamentals in research and design, and I'm comfortable designing digital experiences for the Next Billion Users. My last adventure consisted of enrolling myself in a full-stack bootcamp. As a final project, I created a web app for NGOs in Madrid using React and Python.

 **Skills: PYTHON | SQLAlchemy | REACT | JS | HTML | CSS | BOOTSTRAP**
